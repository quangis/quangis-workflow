These methods are used to construct semantic dimensions (subsumption trees) for
a given list of superconcepts that identify these dimensions. It returns a
projection function which projects any subsumed node to all given dimensions.
None is returned if the node cannot be projected to this dimension. The method
is used to clean annotations such that we can represent them as a conjunction
of concepts from different semantic dimensions.
